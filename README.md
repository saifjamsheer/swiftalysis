### Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling of Taylor Swift's Discography
Taylor Swift has been my favorite artist for the last decade. After her 8th studio album, folklore, released in the middle of the pandemic, I couldn't contain my excitement. I was left in awe by the intricacy and meticulousness of her lyrics and decided to spend some time analyzing the lyrics of one of the greatest musicians of our generation. To combine my passion for her music and my love for data analysis and machine learning, I undertook a personal project to determine the sentiments evoked by her music and the various topics covered. 

I will provide some insight into the steps taken to collect and clean the data by covering the following topics:
* Using the Genius API to fetch the album, track title, and lyrics url of all of Taylor Swift's songs.
* Using the Spotify API to fetch the album and track title of all of Taylor Swift's songs (the reasons for this will be discussed later).
* Eliminating duplicates, unreleased songs, and non-album tracks from the dataset.
