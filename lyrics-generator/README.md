### Taylor Swift Lyrics Generator

Generating lyrics using three methods: 
1. Self-built character-level LSTM text-generation model.
2. Self-built word-level LSTM & GRU text-generation model.
3. Retraining OpenAI's GPT-2 text-generating model on the scraped Taylor Swift lyrics.

> Full implementation steps will be listed once completed.

##### Character-Level Generator

Lyrics generated after 10 epochs with input 'The more I think about it now the less I know':

500 Characters:
[Chorus]
I have that I'm forever
And you want you there what you're the one
I want you so out of it's for my first of this time
Wonded that the whole was the waiting gona
We know I want you

[Bridge]
And they say you said to breathe want

[Bridge]
We forget through the finds on the time
We'll see a fan you story when I'm one up to the night
And then I should wart so one
And there were spent, love a break and tall
Come back to be to make me
I got a gaine
But I don't want you love a bad to fall
```
